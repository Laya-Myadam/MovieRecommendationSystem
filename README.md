# Movie Recommendation System using Machine Learning


This project implements a movie recommendation system using machine learning techniques. The system leverages collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid models to suggest personalized movie recommendations to users.

---

## 📚 Overview

The Movie Recommendation System aims to provide users with movie suggestions based on their preferences and viewing history. By analyzing user-item interactions and movie metadata, the system can recommend movies that align with individual tastes.

---

## 🔧 Features

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Utilizes user-item interaction matrices to recommend movies based on user behavior.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Analyzes movie metadata such as genres, directors, and actors to suggest similar movies.
- **Hybrid Model**: Combines both collaborative and content-based filtering to enhance recommendation accuracy.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides an intuitive interface for users to search and receive movie recommendations.

---

## 📦 Requirements

Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

Install dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

---

## 🧪 Dataset

The system uses a dataset containing movie information, including:

- Movie titles
- Genres
- Directors
- Actors
- User ratings

The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and duplicates, ensuring quality and consistency.

---

## ⚙️ Model Overview

The recommendation system employs the following techniques:

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to predict user-item interactions.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Computes cosine similarity between movie metadata vectors to recommend similar movies.
- **Hybrid Model**: Combines the strengths of both collaborative and content-based filtering methods.

## 🚀 Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies as mentioned above.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook `Movie_Recommendation_System_using_Machine_Learning.ipynb` to explore and utilize the recommendation system.

---

## 📈 Results

The system provides personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences. Evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Precision-Recall are used to assess performance.

---

## 🛠️ Future Improvements

- Incorporate deep learning techniques for more accurate recommendations.
- Implement real-time user feedback to update recommendations dynamically.
- Enhance the user interface for a more interactive experience.
